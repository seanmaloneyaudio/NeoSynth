# NeoSynth
A very basic synth using the Maximilian library, Juce framework, and "The Audio Programmer" tutorials. This is my own unique version.
You will need the "JuceLibraryCode" folder (not included here) to run this with the Juce framework.
While this is my personal audio plugin, it utilizes the Maximilian library by Mick Grierson, as well as strong influence from "The Audio Programmer" on YouTube.
Future additions will include multiple oscillators to choose from at the same time, as well as debugging the filter as it seems to be quite touchy...

Enjoy!
